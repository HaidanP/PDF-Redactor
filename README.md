# PDF Redactor

A secure PDF redaction tool that **actually removes** sensitive content instead of just covering it with black boxes.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in development. Initial implementation focuses on:
- Text-based redaction using PyMuPDF
- Basic CLI interface  
- Metadata sanitization

## 🎯 Goals

- **True Redaction**: Permanently remove content from PDF structure
- **Security First**: Remove metadata, JavaScript, embedded files
- **Smart Detection**: Support text search and regex patterns
- **OCR Support**: Handle scanned PDFs (planned)
- **Offline Operation**: No web dependencies for maximum security

## 📋 Planned Features

- [x] Basic project structure
- [ ] CLI interface implementation
- [ ] Text detection and search
- [ ] Redaction application
- [ ] Metadata sanitization
- [ ] OCR support for scanned PDFs
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (when ready)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Basic usage (when implemented)
python pdfredact/cli.py input.pdf output.pdf --term "CONFIDENTIAL"
